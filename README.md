Hack Mental Health 2019 Hackathon UCSF

### A web app that shares relevant content and community to people suffering from mental health conditions.

This project helps people who are unsure how to talk about their mental state, giving associated words as suggestions. Based on these words and the use of NLP and eventually user behavior data and a recommendation system, we will serve them up the best articles, resources, communities, and services.

For NLP, we will use word2vec and look for N-grams in user testimonials about their experiences.
